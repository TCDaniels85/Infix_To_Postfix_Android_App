# Infix_To_Postfix_Android_App
 Android version of my infix to postfix converter

The aim of this project was to create a visual android application for the infix to postfix converter that I created in a previous university project, which was just a console application. This application can run on any android device and has the additional functionality of being able to switch the applications theme between light mode and dark mode with the use of a toggle located at the bottom of the app screen.

I have included two screenshots below of the in light mode and in dark mode.
